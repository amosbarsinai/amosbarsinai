# Hi there! I'm Amos!

I'm a thirteen-year-old programmer who loves figuring out how things work under the hood—especially computers. I get way too excited about compilers, low-level code, and making my own tools instead of just using what’s already out there. Tov choomi.

### What I'm up to:
- ⚡ Messing around with compilers and assembly
- 🖥️ Developing a multimedia library for Python in C++
- 🕵️‍♂️ Solving issues around repos I use
- 🚀 Experimenting with small OS-level projects and hacks

### Skills & Interests:
- Programming: C++, Python, Assembly
- Graphics & Multimedia
- Linux tinkering
- Reverse engineering and understanding weird tech quirks
