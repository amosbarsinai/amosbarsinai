# Hi there! I'm Amos!

I'm a thirteen-year-old programmer who loves figuring out how things work under the hood. I get way too excited about compilers, low-level code, and making my own tools instead of just using what‚Äôs already out there.

### What I'm up to:
- ‚ö° Messing around with compilers and Assembly (I've tried making a compiler without LLVM a few times, I'm sure you can imagine how it went...)
- üñ•Ô∏è Developing a multimedia library for Python in C++
- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Solving issues around repos I use
- üöÄ Experimenting with small OS-level projects and hacks

### Skills & Interests:
- Math: I recently started learning a bit about neural networks and linear algebra through Grant Sanderson's courses.
- Programming: C++, Python, Assembly
- Graphics & Multimedia
- Linux tinkering
- Reverse engineering and understanding weird tech quirks

### Contact
