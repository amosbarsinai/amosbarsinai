# Hi there! I'm Amos!

I'm a thirteen-year-old programmer who loves figuring out how things work under the hood. I get way too excited about compilers, low-level code, and making my own tools instead of just using what’s already out there.

### What I'm up to:
- ⚡ Messing around with compilers and Assembly (I've tried making a compiler without LLVM a few times...)
- 🖥️ Developing a terminal-based Gentoo installer
- 🚀 Experimenting with small OS-level projects and hacks
- 🇬 Setting up my Gentoo laptop (compiling kernels, etc...😏😏😏)

### Skills & Interests:
- Math: I'm part of the soon-to-be Israel Junior IMO team, so naturally I play around with math a lot.
- Programming: C++, Python, Assembly
- Graphics & Multimedia
- Linux tinkering
- Reverse engineering and understanding weird tech quirks

### Contact
